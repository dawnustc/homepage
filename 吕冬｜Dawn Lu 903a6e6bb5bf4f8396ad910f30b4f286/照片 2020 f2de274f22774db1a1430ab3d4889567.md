把今年的相片放在一起，我看到了一个世外桃源。那里有森林海滩菜园，春花秋叶夕阳，有一个温暖熟悉的小房子是我们的家，有两个孩子自在成长。

When putting this year's photos together, I saw an out-of-this-world dreamland, in which there are forest, beach, garden, fruits, autumn leaves and sunset, and among that, there's a little house we call home, and in that home are two kids being loved just as the way they are. 

虽然镜头里是我们一家的故事，但是今年故事的主题是一个非常被爱着孩子—Luci。这一年里，Luci从一岁到两岁，学会了走路，又会了说话和唱歌。我们看着她的个性开花绽放，渐渐地认识她，这个过程充满喜悦。

Although it's a family story, but this year's theme is a very much loved kid — Luci. In this year, she learnt to walk, talk and sing. We are witnessing her personality blooming. Getting to know Luci is a process full of joy.
